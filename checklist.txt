The site must:

have at least three pages with navigation 
pass through CSS, and any images or JS 
be stored at GitHub as a repository in your GitHub account
be deployed to the web with Netlify from your GitHub account

The focus here is on using 11ty's abstraction capabilities and additional tools that promote that developer experience, Git to create and update a repository at GitHub, and making those changes visible to the web using Netlify. 

Design

Submissions *must* be accompanied with a simple pattern library (colour palette and typefaces).
