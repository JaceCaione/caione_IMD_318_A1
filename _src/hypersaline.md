title: Hypersaline Lakes
---

Much different than the other types of seas, Hypersaline Lakes are lakes that are called seas due to the high saline content in the water. Sometimes these lakes are formed from prehistoric seas or oceans that were then landlocked due to tectonic shifts.

Some famous examples include the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea; however the Caspain sea is *partially freshwater* in the northern portions due to the Volga River draining into it, whilst the southern areas (near Iran and Turkmenistan) have a much higher saline content.
