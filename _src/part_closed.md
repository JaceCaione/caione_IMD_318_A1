title: Partly Enclosed Seas
---

Partly Enclosed seas are another major type of sea; partially landlocked and more connected to the open oceans, these seas have different water circulations than the other major types. Overall they are closer in nature to oceans.

Some examples include the South China Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Bay of Pigs.
