title: Nearly Enclosed Seas
---

Nearly Enclosed seas are a body of water defined by the *almost* complete encirclement of the body. Certain major examples include the famous Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea.

They are connected to the open ocean via narrow waterways known as straits (such as the Gibraltar Strait!); however due to being almost entirely landlocked, these seas have little to no tides and vary wildly in ecosphere, chemical content and physical properties.
